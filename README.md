# fast-nameserver-lookup
Experiments and benchmarking to compare the speed of a Rust-based nameserver lookup to dig

Three things are tested:
- The speed of the [`dns_lookup` crate](https://docs.rs/dns-lookup/latest/dns_lookup/) in Rust. Nothing magic or custom here.
- The speed of a custom Rust implementation of a nameserver lookup. This was made by me and might not follow spec and doesn't seem to be as fast as the `dns_lookup` crate, which uses C bindings. The old adage of "don't reinvent the wheel" rings true.
- The speed of the `dig` command on a Linux machine. This is a common tool for looking up nameservers. If run on Windows, uses `nslookup` instead. `nslookup` seems to be much slower than `dig`.

> [!NOTE]
> Results are highly dependent on the machine and network conditions. Below, you'll find the results a GitHub Actions runner produced.
